# ML4HC-HW1
First homework for the course "Machine Learning for Healthcare" about Neural Networks for abnormal heartbeat detection.

A further explanation can be found in the file [report.pdf](https://github.com/rostro36/ML4HC-HW1/blob/master/report.pdf)

Some data (mitbih_train.csv, mitbih_test.csv) is missing, as it is too big for GitHub and can be downloaded from [Physionet](https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/).
